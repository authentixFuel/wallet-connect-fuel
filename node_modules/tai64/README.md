‚è±Ô∏è TypeScript implementation of TAI64 timestamps for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the browser.

> TAI refers to International Atomic Time (Temps Atomique International in French), the current international real-time standard. One TAI second is defined as the duration of `9192631770` periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium atom.

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
npm install --save tai64
```

### Usage

```javascript
import { TAI64 } from "tai64";

const now = TAI64.now();
const moonLanding = TAI64.fromUnix(
  Math.floor(Date.parse("July 20, 69 00:20:18 UTC") / 1000)
);

console.log("Current date: %s", now.toHexString());
console.log("üöÄüåù Moon Landing: %s", moonLanding.toHexString());
```

## Implementation details

### Immutability

A TAI64 instance is immutable by design and can‚Äôt be modified after it‚Äôs created.

### Long dependency

In ECMAScript, a `Number` is represented as a [double-precision floating-point format number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format) and the largest integer value that can be safely
represented is `2^53-1`. A TAI64 is an integer between `0` and `2^64` referring to a particular second of real time. For that reason, this project uses [long.js](https://github.com/dcodeIO/long.js) as a dependency. In future versions, we will investigate if we have to get rid of this dependency and if the [BigInt](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-bigint) proposal can be used.
